   * Fixed a critical denial of service in TLS 1.3 only server (TLS 1.2 support
     disabled at build time): a TLS client could put the TLS 1.3 only server in
     a infinite loop processing a TLS 1.2 ClientHello. The default
     configuration is not affected. Reported by Matthias Mucha and Thomas
     Blattmann, SICK AG.
