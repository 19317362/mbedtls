   * When negotiating TLS version on server side, do not fallback to the
     TLS 1.2 implementation of the protocol if it is not enabled.
     - If the TLS 1.2 implementation was disabled at build time, a TLS 1.2
       client was able to put the TLS 1.3-only server in an infinite loop
       processing a TLS 1.2 ClientHello, resulting in a Denial of Service.
       Reported by Matthias Mucha and Thomas Blattmann, SICK AG.
     - If the TLS 1.2 implementation was disabled at runtime, a TLS 1.2 client
       was able to successfully established a connection with the TLS 1.3-only
       server. Reported by alluettiv on GitHub.
