Features
   * Add support to remove xxx_setkey_dec and xxx_decrypt for cipher type of
     AES, ARIA, CAMELLIA and DES. This is achieved by implicitly enabling
     MBEDTLS_CIPHER_ENCRYPT_ONLY when
     - ECB and CBC cipher modes are not requested via the PSA API.
     - ECB, CBC, XTS and KW are not enabled in the legacy API.
     - DES is not requested in the PSA API and the legacy API.
