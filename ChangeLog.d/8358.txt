Features
   * It is now possible to accelerate all ciphers and AEADs through a driver,
     while completely removing legacy support and MBEDTLS_CIPHER_C, and still
     get most things working, including TLS - see
     docs/driver-only-builds.md for full details and current limitations.
   * The CTR-DRBG module no longer depends on MBEDTLS_AES_C and can also use
     AES from a PSA driver. This requires MBEDTLS_PSA_CRYPTO_C,
     PSA_WANT_KEY_TYPE_AES and PSA_WANT_ALG_ECB_NO_PADDING to be enabled, and
     MBEDTLS_AES_C to be disabled.
