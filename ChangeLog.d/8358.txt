Features
   * It is now possible to accelerate all ciphers and AEADs through a driver,
     while completely removing legacy support and MBEDTLS_CIPHER_C, and still
     get full functionality. Only unsupported features that still depend on
     MBEDTLS_CIPHER_C are: MBEDTLS_PKCS[5|12]_C and MBEDTLS_NIST_KW_C.
   * CTR-DRBG module can now take advantage of PSA driver. Legacy
     MBEDTLS_AES_C is still the preferred solution, but when it's not available
     it can rely on PSA if PSA_WANT_KEY_TYPE_AES and PSA_WANT_ALG_ECB_NO_PADDING
     are defined.
