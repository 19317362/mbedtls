New deprecations
   * MBEDTLS_CIPHER_BLKSIZE_MAX is deprecated in favor of
     MBEDTLS_MAX_BLOCK_LENGTH (if you intended what the name suggests:
     maximum size of any supported block cipher) or the new name
     MBEDTLS_CMAC_MAX_BLOCK_SIZE (if you intended the actual semantics:
     maximum size of a block cipher supported by the CMAC module).

Security
   * In configurations with ARIA or Camellia but not AES, the value of
     MBEDTLS_CIPHER_BLKSIZE_MAX was 8, rather than 16 as the name might
     suggest. This did not affect any library code, because this macro was
     only used in relation with CMAC which does not support these ciphers.
     This may affect application code that uses this macro.
