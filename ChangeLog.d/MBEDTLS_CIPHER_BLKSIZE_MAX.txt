Changes
   * In configurations with ARIA or Camellia but not AES, the value of
     MBEDTLS_CIPHER_BLKSIZE_MAX was 8, rather than 16 as the name might
     suggest. This did not affect any library code, because this macro was
     only used in relation with CMAC which does not support these ciphers.
     Its value is now 16 if ARIA or Camellia are present. This may affect
     application code that uses this macro.
