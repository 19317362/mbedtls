   * Fix non-constant-time behaviour in padding calculations in CBC
     decryption, NIST SP 800-38F key wrapping, and RSAAES-OAEP decryption.
     For CBC and RSAAES-OAEP, this may have been exploitable in a
     padding oracle for a privileged local attacker with the ability to
     observe memory access timings.
