   * Fix a remotely exploitable heap buffer overflow in TLS handshake parsing.
     In TLS 1.3, all configurations are affected except PSK-only ones, and
     both clients and servers are affected.
     In TLS 1.2, the affected configurations are those with
     MBEDTLS_USE_PSA_CRYPTO and ECDH enabled but DHM and RSA disabled,
     and only servers are affected, not clients.
