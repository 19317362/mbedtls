   * Developers using mbedtls_pkcs5_pbes2() should review the size of the output
     buffer passed to this function, and note that the output after decryption
     may include CBC padding. Consider moving to the new function
     mbedtls_pkcs5_pbes2_ext() which checks for overflow of the output buffer
     and reports the actual length of the output.
