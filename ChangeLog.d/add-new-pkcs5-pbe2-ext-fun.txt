   * Developers using mbedtls_pkcs5_pbes2() or mbedtls_pkcs12_pbe() should review
     the size of the output buffer passed to this function, and note that the
     output after decryption may include CBC padding. Consider moving to the
     new functions mbedtls_pkcs5_pbes2_ext() or mbedtls_pkcs12_pbe_ext() which
     checks for overflow of the output buffer and reports the actual length
     of the output.
