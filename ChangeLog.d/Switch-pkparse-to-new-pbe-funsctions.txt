New deprecations
   * mbedtls_pkcs5_pbes2() and mbedtls_pkcs12_pbe() functions are now
     deprecated in favor of mbedtls_pkcs5_pbes2_ext() and
     mbedtls_pkcs12_pbe_ext() as they offer more security by checking
     for overflow of the output buffer and reporting the actual length
     of the output.

Bugfix
   * mbedtls_pk_parse_key() now rejects trailing garbage in encrypted keys.
