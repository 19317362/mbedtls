Security
   * It was possible to configure MBEDTLS_ECP_MAX_BITS to a value that is
     too small, leading to buffer overflows in ECC operations. Fail the build
     in such a case.

Features
   * MBEDTLS_ECP_MAX_BITS is now determined automatically from the configured
     curves and no longer needs to be configured explicitly to save RAM.
