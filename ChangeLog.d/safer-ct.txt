   * Updates to constant time C code so that compilers are less likely to use
     conditional instructions, which might have an observable difference in
     timing (Clang was observed to generate conditional instructions).
     Introduce assembly implementations of constant time code for
     Thumb 1 & Thumb 2, 32-bit Arm, aarch64, x86 and x86-64, which are
     guaranteed not to use conditional instructions.
