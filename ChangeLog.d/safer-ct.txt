   * Updates to constant-time C code so that compilers are less likely to use
     conditional instructions, which can have an observable difference in
     timing. (Clang has been seen to do this.) Also introduce assembly
     implementations for 32- and 64-bit Arm and for x86 and x86-64, which are
     guaranteed not to use conditional instructions.
