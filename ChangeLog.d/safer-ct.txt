   * Updates to constant time C code so that compilers are less likely to use
     conditional instructions (Clang was observed to use these). Conditional
     instructions might have an observable difference in timing. Introduce
     assembly implementations for 32 and 64-bit Arm and for x86 and x86-64,
     which are guaranteed not to use conditional instructions.
