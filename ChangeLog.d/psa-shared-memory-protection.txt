Security
   * Support calling PSA functions with buffer arguments that are in memory
     shared with an untrusted party. The PSA core now makes copies of all
     buffers before passing them to drivers to protect drivers against
     modification of buffers during operations.
     This feature increases code-size and memory usage. If buffers passed to
     PSA functions are all trusted, buffer copying may be disabled by
     unsetting MBEDTLS_PSA_COPY_CALLER_BUFFERS.
