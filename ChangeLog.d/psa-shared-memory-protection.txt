Security
   * Passing buffers that are stored in untrusted memory as arguments
     to PSA functions is now secure by default.
     The PSA core now protects against modification of inputs or exposure
     of intermediate outputs during operations. This is currently implemented
     by copying buffers.
     This feature increases code size and memory usage. If buffers passed to
     PSA functions are owned exclusively by the PSA core for the duration of
     the function call (i.e. no buffer parameters are in shared memory),
     copying may be disabled by setting MBEDTLS_PSA_ASSUME_EXCLUSIVE_BUFFERS.
     Note that setting this option will cause input-output buffer overlap to
     be only partially supported (#3266).
     Fixes CVE-2024-28960
Bugfix
   * Fully support arbitrary overlap between inputs and outputs of PSA
     functions. Note that overlap is still only partially supported when
     MBEDTLS_PSA_ASSUME_EXCLUSIVE_BUFFERS is set (#3266).
