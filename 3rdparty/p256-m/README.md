The files within the `p256-m/` subdirectory originate from the [p256-m GitHub repository](https://github.com/mpg/p256-m), which is distributed under the Apache 2.0 license. They are authored by Manuel Pégourié-Gonnard. p256-m is a minimalistic implementation of ECDH and ECDSA on NIST P-256, especially suited to constrained 32-bit environments. Mbed TLS documentation for integrating drivers uses p256-m as an example of a software accelerator, and describes how it can be integrated alongside Mbed TLS.

The files `p256-m.c` and `.h`, along with the license, have been taken from the `p256-m` repository.
It should be noted that p256-m deliberately does not supply its own cryptographically secure RNG function. As a result, an RNG function using `mbedtls_ctr_dbrg` has been implemented and added to `p256m.c`.
